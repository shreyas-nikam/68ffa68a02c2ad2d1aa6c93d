# Enhancing LLM-Generated Code with Property-Based Testing (PBT)

## 1. Application Overview and Key Concepts
Duration: 00:05:00

Welcome to this interactive lab, **QuLab**, where we delve into advanced techniques for improving the quality and robustness of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). This application provides a hands-on comparison between **Property-Based Testing (PBT)** and **Traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD)** as methods for refining LLM-generated code.

### Why is this important?
Large Language Models are revolutionizing software development by accelerating code generation. However, code produced by LLMs, while often functional, can sometimes contain subtle bugs, fail to handle edge cases gracefully, or behave unexpectedly under diverse inputs. Traditional unit tests, which rely on specific examples, may not be sufficient to uncover these issues.

This is where **Property-Based Testing (PBT)** shines. Instead of testing with specific inputs, PBT defines high-level *properties* or invariants that the code should always satisfy. It then systematically generates a wide range of diverse inputs to try and *falsify* these properties.

<aside class="positive">
<b>PBT is particularly effective for LLM-generated code because:</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Comprehensive Coverage:</b> It explores a much broader input space than hand-written examples, drastically increasing the chances of finding obscure bugs.</li>
  <li><b>Robustness:</b> It helps ensure the code behaves correctly even under unusual or unexpected conditions.</li>
  <li><b>Automated Feedback:</b> When a property is violated, PBT provides concrete, minimal examples of failing inputs, which can be invaluable feedback for refining the LLM's output.</li>
</ul>
</aside>

### The Iterative Refinement Process
This application simulates an iterative refinement process using the **PGS (Propose, Generate, Synthesize)** framework, where two LLM-powered agents collaborate:

1.  **Generator Agent:** This agent's role is to synthesize initial code based on a problem description and then refine it iteratively based on feedback.
2.  **Tester Agent:** This agent is responsible for generating diverse test inputs (for PBT) or specific test cases (for TDD) and then validating the code against defined properties or expected behaviors. It aims to *break* the code to provide actionable feedback.

Throughout this interactive experience, you will:
*   Understand the fundamental differences and advantages of PBT over TDD.
*   Visualize how code evolves through PBT-driven feedback.
*   Quantitatively compare PBT against TDD using metrics like `correctness_rate` and `repair_success_rate`.
*   Explore the **HumanEval** dataset, a common benchmark for code generation.

Let's begin our journey to make LLM-generated code more reliable and robust!

## 2. Environment Setup
Duration: 00:02:00

This section outlines the general requirements for setting up the environment to run applications like QuLab. While this particular Streamlit application is already deployed for your use, understanding the typical setup is beneficial for any similar development.

### What you would typically need:
*   **Python Version:** Python 3.9 or higher is generally recommended for modern machine learning and Streamlit applications.
*   **Dependencies:** All required Python packages are listed in a `requirements.txt` file. In a local setup, you would install them using pip:
    ```console
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
*   **LLM API Keys:** If this were a real-time interaction with an LLM (instead of mock functions), you would need to configure API keys for services like OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, etc. This often involves setting environment variables:
    ```console
    export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
    ```
*   **Code Structure:** The application is organized into `app.py` (the main entry point) and an `application_pages` directory, where each navigation page has its own Python file. This modular structure helps manage complex Streamlit applications.

For the purpose of this codelab, we assume a compatible Python environment with necessary dependencies is already established, allowing you to focus purely on the application's functionalities and concepts.

## 3. Understanding the HumanEval Dataset
Duration: 00:03:00

The **HumanEval dataset** is a critical component in evaluating the code generation capabilities of Large Language Models. It serves as a benchmark, providing a standardized set of programming problems against which LLM performance can be measured.

### Dataset Structure
Each problem within the HumanEval dataset is carefully crafted and typically includes the following key fields:

*   `task_id`: A unique identifier for the specific programming problem (e.g., "HumanEval/0").
*   `prompt`: This is the natural language problem description, exactly as an LLM would receive it. It defines what the function should do.
*   `entry_point`: The name of the function that the LLM is expected to implement (e.g., `has_close_elements`).
*   `canonical_solution`: A reference, correct Python solution to the problem. This is used for comparison and validation.
*   `test`: Python code containing a suite of unit tests designed to verify the correctness of any submitted solution. These tests are essential for both TDD and PBT evaluation.
*   `declaration`: The function signature, providing the initial `def` statement for the function to be implemented.

### Loading the Dataset
To interact with the dataset, you need to load it into the application.

1.  Navigate to the "3. Data/Inputs Overview" page in the sidebar.
2.  Click the "Load HumanEval Dataset" button.

<aside class="positive">
A loading spinner will appear, and once complete, you will see a success message and a sample of the dataset displayed as a table. This confirms the dataset is ready for use in subsequent steps.
</aside>

<br/>
Once loaded, you will see a preview of the dataset. For instance, the first few entries might look like this (illustrative example):
```
    task_id                                             prompt  ...      test
0  HumanEval/0  Given a list of numbers, return whether or not ...  ...  def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(...
1  HumanEval/1  Given a string, return the string with all upp...  ...  def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(...
2  HumanEval/2  Given an array of non-negative integers, retur...  ...  def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(...
```
This table shows the `task_id`, a truncated version of the `prompt`, and the `test` code. The application will also inform you about the total number of problems in the dataset.

## 4. Deep Dive into Methodologies: TDD, PBT, and PGS Framework
Duration: 00:08:00

This section is fundamental to understanding the core concepts demonstrated in this lab. We'll explore Traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Property-Based Testing (PBT), along with the iterative **PGS (Propose, Generate, Synthesize)** framework that orchestrates the interactions between LLM agents.

### Traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD)
TDD is a software development methodology where tests are written *before* the code. The cycle is typically as follows:

1.  **Write a Failing Test:** A developer writes a unit test for a specific piece of functionality, expecting it to fail initially because the corresponding code hasn't been written yet.
2.  **Write Code:** The minimum amount of code required to make the newly written test pass is then implemented.
3.  **Refactor:** The code is refactored to improve its design, readability, and maintainability, all while ensuring that the existing tests continue to pass.

When applied to LLM-generated code, TDD usually involves providing the LLM with a problem description and a set of concrete input-output examples as tests. The LLM then attempts to generate code that passes these specific examples.

### Property-Based Testing (PBT)
PBT represents a paradigm shift from example-based testing to **property-based testing**. Instead of defining what the output should be for specific inputs, PBT defines **properties** â€“ high-level invariants or truths that the code should always uphold, regardless of the input.

The PBT workflow involves:

1.  **Define Properties:** Identify fundamental truths about the function's behavior. For example, a sorting function should always return a sorted list, and its output length should match its input length.
2.  **Generate Inputs:** A PBT framework (like Hypothesis in Python) generates a wide range of random, yet valid, inputs that conform to specified types (e.g., lists of integers, strings, etc.).
3.  **Verify Properties:** The code under test is executed with these generated inputs, and its output is checked against the defined properties.
4.  **Shrink Failing Cases:** If a property fails, the PBT framework attempts to "shrink" the failing input to the simplest possible example that still causes the failure. This minimal example is crucial for easier debugging and providing clear feedback.

<aside class="positive">
<b>PBT's strength for LLM-generated code:</b> It can uncover edge cases and subtle bugs that might be missed by a limited set of hand-crafted TDD examples, leading to more robust and reliable code.
</aside>

### The PGS (Propose, Generate, Synthesize) Framework
The PGS framework models an iterative refinement loop using two distinct, LLM-powered agents:

1.  **Generator Agent (Propose & Generate):**
    *   **Role:** This agent is responsible for the creative aspect: synthesizing an initial code solution based on the problem prompt. It also takes on the task of refining this code based on feedback received from the Tester Agent.
    *   **Input:** The problem description, any previous code attempts, and the detailed feedback (error reports, failing examples) from the Tester Agent.
    *   **Output:** A new or improved version of the code.

2.  **Tester Agent (Synthesize):**
    *   **Role:** This agent acts as the critic and validator. It generates test inputs and executes tests to evaluate the correctness of the Generator's code. For TDD, it uses specific examples. For PBT, it generates inputs to try and break defined properties.
    *   **Input (TDD):** The code from the Generator and specific unit test cases (e.g., from HumanEval).
    *   **Input (PBT):** The code from the Generator and the defined properties.
    *   **Output:** Test results (pass/fail), error messages, and crucially, failing inputs (especially for PBT, where shrunk examples are provided).

The interaction between these agents forms a continuous feedback loop:

$$ \text{Generator (Code)} \xrightarrow{\text{submit}} \text{Tester (Feedback)} \xrightarrow{\text{refine}} \text{Generator (New Code)} $$

This loop allows the LLM-generated code to iteratively improve, addressing identified issues and becoming more robust and accurate with each refinement step.

### Key Metrics for Comparison
To quantitatively assess the effectiveness of PBT versus TDD, we will use several metrics:

*   **Correctness Rate:** The percentage of problems for which the LLM eventually produces a correct solution that passes all tests (or properties).
    $$ \text{Correctness Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Solutions}}{\text{Total Number of Problems}} $$
*   **Repair Success Rate:** How often the LLM successfully fixes issues identified by the testing method in a subsequent iteration.
    $$ \text{Repair Success Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Successful Repairs}}{\text{Number of Identified Issues}} $$
*   **Number of Iterations to Solution:** The average number of refinement steps required for the LLM to achieve a correct and robust solution for a given problem.
*   **Test Coverage (PBT specific):** For PBT, this metric (often simulated or estimated) indicates how effectively the generated inputs explored the function's input space.
*   **Semantic Feedback Efficiency:** A measure of how well the feedback from each testing method guides the LLM towards semantically accurate and logically sound solutions, rather than just patching specific examples.

These metrics will provide a clear, data-driven comparison of PBT's advantages in improving LLM-generated code.

## 5. Interactive Code Refinement
Duration: 00:10:00

This is the central interactive section of the application where you can directly observe and participate in the iterative refinement of LLM-generated code. You will see how feedback from either PBT or TDD guides the LLM (simulated) towards a correct solution.

1.  **Select a HumanEval Problem:**
    *   First, ensure you have loaded the HumanEval dataset from the "3. Data/Inputs Overview" page. If not, please go back and do so.
    *   On the "5. Sectioned Implementation" page, you will find a dropdown menu labeled "Select HumanEval Problem". Choose any problem from the list. The problem's prompt and entry point will be displayed below your selection.

2.  **Configure Refinement Parameters:**
    *   **Max Refinement Iterations:** This slider allows you to set the maximum number of attempts the LLM will make to refine the code. A higher number gives the LLM more chances to correct its code.
    *   **Test Timeout (seconds):** This parameter defines how long the test execution will run before timing out. This is crucial for preventing infinite loops in LLM-generated code.

3.  **Review Initial LLM-Generated Code:**
    *   Below the problem description, you will see a section titled "Initial LLM-Generated Code (Mock)". This represents the first attempt by the Generator Agent to solve the problem based on the prompt. This code is typically a plausible but often incorrect or incomplete solution.

4.  **Choose Your Testing Method:**
    *   In the "Select Testing Method" section, use the radio buttons to choose between "Property-Based Testing (PBT)" and "Traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD)".
    *   **PBT** will attempt to define and check high-level properties.
    *   **TDD** will use specific example-based tests (from the HumanEval dataset).

5.  **Run the Refinement Loop:**
    *   Once you have selected a problem and a testing method, click the "Run Refinement Loop" button.
    *   The application will simulate the iterative PGS framework:
        *   **Iteration Start:** An information message will indicate the current iteration.
        *   **Tester Agent at Work:** Depending on your chosen method, the mock Tester Agent will either execute PBT properties or TDD tests against the `current_code`.
        *   **Feedback:** If issues are found (property violations for PBT, test failures for TDD), a warning message will appear detailing the feedback (e.g., "Property violation detected" or "TDD test failures detected").
        *   **Generator Agent Refinement:** Based on this feedback, the mock Generator Agent will attempt to refine the code.
        *   **Success/Continue:** If the code passes all tests/properties, a success message will appear, and the loop will stop. Otherwise, it will continue to the next iteration (up to `Max Refinement Iterations`).

<aside class="negative">
Remember, the LLM and test execution are *mocked* in this application for demonstration purposes. While it simulates the process, it's not actually calling a live LLM or running real code execution in a sandbox. The feedback and refinements are illustrative examples to convey the concept.
</aside>

6.  **Review Refinement History and Final Code:**
    *   After the loop completes (either due to success or reaching max iterations), two new sections will appear:
        *   **Refinement History:** A table summarizing each iteration, including the code attempt (truncated), the feedback received, and whether it was considered correct.
        *   **Final Refined Code:** The last version of the code produced by the LLM after all refinement attempts.

7.  **Explore Detailed Feedback History:**
    *   An expandable section, "Detailed Feedback History", allows you to review the specific feedback and (truncated) code for each iteration in more detail. This is where you would typically see the concrete failing inputs from PBT or specific assertion failures from TDD.

Interact with this section multiple times, trying different problems and comparing the refinement paths under PBT versus TDD. Observe how the feedback changes and how the LLM attempts to adjust its code.

## 6. Quantitative Comparison
Duration: 00:05:00

Having explored the interactive refinement, this section allows you to quantitatively compare Property-Based Testing (PBT) and Traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) across multiple problems. We will run a mock benchmark evaluation and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
We revisit the important metrics introduced in the Methodology Overview:

*   **Correctness Rate:** The percentage of problems for which the LLM successfully generates a correct solution within the allowed iterations.
    $$ \text{Correctness Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Solutions}}{\text{Total Number of Problems}} $$
*   **Repair Success Rate:** How often the LLM successfully fixes issues identified by the testing method when given feedback.
    $$ \text{Repair Success Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Successful Repairs}}{\text{Number of Identified Issues}} $$
*   **Iterations to Solution:** The average number of refinement steps needed for the LLM to arrive at a correct solution. Lower values are better.
*   **Test Coverage Score (PBT-specific):** An indicator of how broadly the input space was explored by generated tests, providing a sense of thoroughness.
*   **Semantic Feedback Efficiency:** A measure of how effectively the feedback from the testing method guides the LLM to logically sound and semantically correct code.

### Running the Benchmark Evaluation

1.  Navigate to the "6. Quantitative Comparison" page.
2.  Configure the benchmark parameters:
    *   **Number of problems for benchmark:** Specify how many HumanEval problems the mock evaluation will run on. A higher number provides a more comprehensive comparison.
    *   **Max Refinement Iterations (Benchmark):** This sets the maximum iterations for *each* problem during the benchmark run.

3.  Click the "Run Benchmark Evaluation" button.
    *   The application will simulate running both PBT and TDD refinement loops for the specified number of problems, collecting data on the KPIs. This process will take a few seconds.

4.  **Review the Results:**
    *   Upon completion, you will see three dataframes:
        *   **PBT Evaluation Results:** Detailed results for each problem when refined using PBT.
        *   **TDD Evaluation Results:** Detailed results for each problem when refined using TDD.
        *   **Combined Evaluation Results:** A consolidated view for easier comparison.

<aside class="positive">
These tables provide the raw data for our comparison. The next step, "7. Visualization of Results," will offer interactive charts to help you interpret these numbers more easily.
</aside>

Observe the differences in metrics between PBT and TDD. You might notice PBT generally shows higher correctness rates, repair success rates, and potentially fewer iterations to solution, alongside a 'Test Coverage Score' that is typically not applicable or lower for TDD.

## 7. Visualization of Results
Duration: 00:07:00

This section brings the quantitative data from the benchmark to life through interactive charts, making it easier to compare the performance of Property-Based Testing (PBT) and Traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD).

1.  **Ensure Benchmark Data is Available:**
    *   Before proceeding, make sure you have run the "Benchmark Evaluation" on the "6. Quantitative Comparison" page. If no data is available, you will be prompted to run the benchmark first.

2.  **Explore Per-Iteration Trends (Illustrative):**
    *   You will see line plots titled "Correctness Rate vs. Iterations (Illustrative)" and "Repair Success Rate vs. Iterations (Illustrative)".
    *   These plots help visualize a hypothetical trend of how correctness and repair success might evolve over refinement iterations for both PBT and TDD. While the underlying data for these specific plots is mock-generated to show a trend, it represents the expected behavior discussed in theory.
    *   Observe how PBT might achieve a higher correctness rate faster or maintain a better repair success rate across iterations compared to TDD.

3.  **Analyze Average Performance Comparison:**
    *   Below the line plots, you'll find a series of bar charts, each comparing the average performance of PBT and TDD for a specific metric (e.g., "Average Correctness Rate," "Average Repair Success Rate," "Average Iterations to Solution").
    *   These charts provide a clear visual summary of the overall effectiveness of each method across the problems evaluated in the benchmark.
    *   Pay close attention to metrics like "Iterations to Solution," where a lower bar for PBT would suggest faster convergence to a correct solution. For "Test Coverage Score," PBT is expected to show a significant advantage due to its input generation strategy.

4.  **Detailed Metric Comparison per Problem:**
    *   A dropdown menu, "Select a metric to visualize across problems," allows you to choose any of the performance indicators.
    *   After selecting a metric, a scatter plot will display the chosen metric's value for each individual problem, categorized by testing method (PBT or TDD).
    *   This granular view lets you identify if one method consistently outperforms the other across different problem types, or if there are specific problems where one method struggles more than the other. Hover over the points to see details for each problem.

<aside class="positive">
Interpreting these visualizations will reinforce your understanding of why PBT is considered a more robust and efficient approach for refining LLM-generated code, especially in scenarios requiring comprehensive testing and resilience to edge cases.
</aside>

These visualizations are powerful tools for drawing conclusions about the comparative strengths and weaknesses of PBT and TDD in the context of LLM code refinement.

## 8. Summary and Insights
Duration: 00:03:00

This final section brings together the key findings and insights gleaned from our exploration of Property-Based Testing (PBT) versus Traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) for refining LLM-generated code.

### Key Takeaways:

1.  **PBT's Strength in Edge Case Discovery:** Our exploration demonstrated PBT's superior ability to uncover subtle bugs and edge cases that often elude specific, example-based TDD tests. The systematic, generative nature of PBT's input exploration leads to code that is more robust and less prone to unexpected failures.

2.  **Faster Refinement with PBT-driven Feedback:** The high-quality, semantic feedback provided by PBTâ€”especially the generation of minimal failing examplesâ€”significantly accelerates the LLM's refinement process. This typically translates to fewer iterations required to achieve a correct and resilient solution, as observed in the "Iterations to Solution" metric in the quantitative comparison.

3.  **Improved Code Quality and Robustness:** While TDD helps ensure functional correctness for known examples, PBT pushes the LLM to generate code that adheres to fundamental properties. This results in code that is not just "correct" for specific inputs, but also semantically more robust and resilient across a broad spectrum of valid inputs.

4.  **Challenges and Considerations:**
    *   **Property Definition:** Defining effective and comprehensive properties for complex functions can be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the problem domain. Poorly defined properties can lead to ineffective testing.
    *   **LLM Interpretation of Feedback:** The actual effectiveness of PBT also depends on the LLM's capability to accurately interpret and act upon the feedback from property violations. As LLMs continue to advance, their ability to leverage this rich feedback will only improve.
    *   **Performance Overhead:** PBT can sometimes involve running a larger number of generated tests than a typical TDD suite, which might incur higher computational overhead, especially for very complex properties or computationally intensive code.

### Visualizing Overall Trends
Based on our mock benchmark and the principles discussed, we generally expect PBT to show superior performance across several metrics. Below are illustrative visualizations summarizing these trends (these are based on the benchmark data if you ran it, or illustrative if not):

**Average Correctness Rate (PBT vs TDD)**
(A bar chart showing PBT with a higher average correctness rate than TDD)

**Average Iterations to Solution (PBT vs TDD)**
(A bar chart showing PBT with fewer average iterations to solution than TDD)

**Average Test Coverage Score (PBT vs TDD)**
(A bar chart showing PBT with a higher average test coverage score than TDD)

### Conclusion:
This lab highlights the significant potential of Property-Based Testing as a powerful tool for developing and refining robust code, especially when working with LLM-generated outputs. By shifting the focus from specific examples to the fundamental *behavior* of the code, PBT fosters a deeper understanding of correctness and leads to more resilient software systems.

As LLMs continue to advance and integrate more deeply into our development workflows, embracing sophisticated testing paradigms like PBT will be crucial for ensuring the reliability, trustworthiness, and overall quality of AI-generated code.
