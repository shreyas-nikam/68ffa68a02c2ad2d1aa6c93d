    This section would typically describe how to set up the development environment, including:

    *   **Python Version:** e.g., Python 3.9+
    *   **Dependencies:** List of required Python packages, which are also captured in `requirements.txt`.
        You can install them using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    *   **LLM API Keys:** Instructions for configuring API keys for Large Language Models (if applicable in a real deployment).
    *   **Code Structure:** An overview of the project directory structure.

    For this lab, we assume a compatible Python environment with the listed dependencies is already set up.
