# QuLab: Mastering LLM Code Robustness with Property-Based Testing

## 1. Introduction to QuLab: Property-Based Testing for LLM-Generated Code
Duration: 0:08:00

Welcome to QuLab, a comprehensive guide designed to equip developers with an in-depth understanding of **Property-Based Testing (PBT)**, particularly in the context of refining code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). This codelab will highlight why PBT is a superior approach compared to Traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) for ensuring the robustness and correctness of LLM-generated code.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Why is this application important?</b> The increasing reliance on LLMs for code generation necessitates robust validation methods. Traditional testing often falls short, missing subtle errors or edge cases. This application demonstrates how PBT can fill that gap, leading to more reliable AI-assisted software development.
</aside>

### The Challenge of LLM-Generated Code
While LLMs are powerful, their generated code can often be subtly incorrect, struggle with edge cases, or fail under unusual input distributions. Relying solely on a few hand-crafted unit tests (typical in TDD) can leave significant gaps in code validation. PBT addresses this by focusing on *properties* — high-level invariants that the code should always satisfy, irrespective of the input. It then intelligently generates diverse inputs to rigorously try and *falsify* these properties.

### Property-Based Testing (PBT) vs. Traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD)
*   **TDD:** Focuses on writing tests for *specific examples* (input-output pairs). It's excellent for verifying known behaviors but limited in discovering unexpected failures.
*   **PBT:** Focuses on *general properties* the code must uphold for all valid inputs. It uses intelligent test data generation to explore a vast input space, leading to more comprehensive bug discovery and robust code.

### The Iterative Refinement Process with PGS Framework
This application simulates an iterative refinement loop using the **PGS (Propose, Generate, Synthesize)** framework, involving two LLM-powered agents:

1.  **Generator Agent:** Proposes initial code and refines it based on feedback.
2.  **Tester Agent:** Generates diverse test inputs (PBT) or specific test cases (TDD) and validates code properties/correctness.

This feedback loop is crucial for the continuous improvement of LLM-generated code.

#### High-Level Application Architecture
The Streamlit application `app.py` acts as the orchestrator, loading different functionalities (pages) dynamically via a sidebar navigation.

Let's begin exploring the functionalities of QuLab!

## 2. Setting Up Your Development Environment
Duration: 0:03:00

To run the QuLab Streamlit application locally, you need a Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed.

### Python Version
Ensure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed on your system. You can check your Python version using:

```console
python --version
```

### Project Structure
The application is organized into a main `app.py` file and a directory `application_pages/` containing modules for each section of the codelab.

```
.
├── app.py
└── application_pages/
    ├── page1_overview.py
    ├── page2_env_setup.py
    ├── page3_data_inputs.py
    ├── page4_methodology.py
    ├── page5_implementation.py
    ├── page6_quantitative_comparison.py
    ├── page7_visualization.py
    └── page8_summary.py
```

### Dependencies
The application relies on several Python libraries. While a `requirements.txt` was not explicitly provided, we can infer the necessary packages from the `import` statements in the code:

```
streamlit
pandas
datasets
plotly-express
```

You can create a `requirements.txt` file with the above content and install them using `pip`:

```console
# Create the requirements.txt file
echo "streamlit" > requirements.txt
echo "pandas" >> requirements.txt
echo "datasets" >> requirements.txt
echo "plotly-express" >> requirements.txt

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<aside class="negative">
If you encounter issues installing `datasets`, you might need to install `apache-arrow` and `pyarrow` first, or ensure your `pip` is up to date. Some users also report needing `huggingface-hub` which is often a dependency for `datasets`.
</aside>

### Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run the Streamlit application:

```console
streamlit run app.py
```
This command will open the QuLab application in your default web browser.

## 3. Understanding the HumanEval Dataset
Duration: 0:05:00

The **HumanEval dataset** is a critical component of this application, serving as a benchmark for evaluating the code generation capabilities of LLMs. This section will guide you through loading and understanding its structure within the QuLab application.

### What is HumanEval?
HumanEval consists of 164 programming problems, each designed to test an LLM's ability to generate functional Python code. Each problem comes with:
*   A natural language problem description (`prompt`).
*   A function signature to be implemented (`entry_point`).
*   A canonical (correct) solution (`canonical_solution`).
*   A set of unit tests (`test`) to verify the generated code.

### Loading the Dataset in QuLab
Navigate to the **"3. Data/Inputs Overview"** page using the sidebar. On this page, you'll find a button to load the HumanEval dataset.

```python
# application_pages/page3_data_inputs.py
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
from datasets import load_dataset

@st.cache_data
def load_humaneval_dataset():
    """Loads the HumanEval dataset and returns it."""
    with st.spinner("Loading HumanEval dataset... This might take a moment."):
        try:
            dataset = load_dataset("openai_humaneval")
            st.success("HumanEval dataset loaded successfully!")
            return dataset
        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"Error loading HumanEval dataset: {e}")
            return None

def run_page():
    st.header("3. Data/Inputs Overview")
    st.markdown("""
    The **HumanEval dataset** serves as a benchmark for evaluating the code generation capabilities of Large Language Models.
    It consists of 164 programming problems, each with a problem description, a canonical solution, and a set of unit tests.

    ### Dataset Structure
    Each problem in the HumanEval dataset typically includes the following fields:

    *   `task_id`: A unique identifier for the problem (e.g., "HumanEval/0").
    *   `prompt`: The natural language problem description that an LLM would receive.
    *   `entry_point`: The name of the function to be implemented.
    *   `canonical_solution`: A correct Python solution to the problem.
    *   `test`: Python code containing unit tests to verify the correctness of a submitted solution.
    *   `declaration`: The function signature for the problem.

    ### Loading the Dataset
    Use the button below to load the HumanEval dataset into the application's memory.
    Once loaded, a sample of the dataset will be displayed.
    """)

    if st.button("Load HumanEval Dataset"):
        st.session_state.humaneval_dataset = load_humaneval_dataset()

    if "humaneval_dataset" in st.session_state and st.session_state.humaneval_dataset is not None:
        st.subheader("Sample of HumanEval Dataset")
        st.dataframe(st.session_state.humaneval_dataset["test"].to_pandas().head())

        humaneval_dataset_task_ids = st.session_state.humaneval_dataset["test"]["task_id"].tolist()
        if humaneval_dataset_task_ids:
            st.session_state.humaneval_dataset_task_ids = humaneval_dataset_task_ids

        st.markdown(f"""
        The dataset contains {len(st.session_state.humaneval_dataset["test"])} problems.
        You can select a specific problem in the "5. Sectioned Implementation" page.
        """)
    else:
        st.info("Dataset not loaded yet. Click the 'Load HumanEval Dataset' button above.")
```

Click the **"Load HumanEval Dataset"** button. The application will fetch the dataset using the `datasets` library and store it in Streamlit's session state. A sample of the dataset will then be displayed, showing the first few problems.

<aside class="positive">
Using <b>`@st.cache_data`</b> for `load_humaneval_dataset` is a best practice in Streamlit. It ensures that the dataset is loaded only once, even if the user interacts with other widgets, significantly improving application performance.
</aside>

Observe the columns like `task_id`, `prompt`, `entry_point`, and `test`. These are crucial for understanding the problem and how tests are applied to LLM-generated solutions.

## 4. Deep Dive into Testing Methodologies (TDD & PBT) and the PGS Framework
Duration: 0:10:00

This section elaborates on the core methodologies central to QuLab: Traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Property-Based Testing (PBT), along with the iterative PGS (Propose, Generate, Synthesize) framework that orchestrates LLM interactions.

### Traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD)
TDD is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:

1.  **Red:** Write a test that fails.
2.  **Green:** Write just enough code to make the test pass.
3.  **Refactor:** Improve the code's design without altering its behavior.

When applied to LLMs, the "Green" step involves the LLM generating code that passes a set of *specific, predefined unit tests*. The feedback is typically binary (pass/fail) and tied to concrete examples.

### Property-Based Testing (PBT)
PBT is a paradigm shift where you define *properties* (invariants or truths) that your code should always satisfy, irrespective of the input. Instead of specific examples, PBT frameworks (like Hypothesis in Python) generate a wide range of diverse inputs to try and *falsify* these properties.

**PBT Workflow:**
1.  **Define Properties:** State high-level truths about the function's behavior (e.g., "adding 0 to a number should return the number").
2.  **Generate Inputs:** The PBT framework intelligently generates numerous random, valid inputs.
3.  **Verify Properties:** Execute the code with generated inputs and check if properties hold.
4.  **Shrink Failing Cases:** If a property fails, the framework finds the *minimal* failing input, simplifying debugging.

PBT is particularly effective for LLM-generated code because LLMs can produce subtle bugs that traditional example-based tests might miss. PBT's comprehensive input exploration helps uncover these issues, leading to more robust solutions.

### The PGS (Propose, Generate, Synthesize) Framework
The PGS framework is an iterative human-in-the-loop or agent-in-the-loop process designed for LLM code refinement. It involves two LLM-powered agents:

1.  **Generator Agent:**
    *   **Role:** Synthesizes the initial code and refines it based on feedback.
    *   **Input:** Problem description, previous code, and feedback from the Tester Agent.
    *   **Output:** New or revised code.

2.  **Tester Agent:**
    *   **Role:** Generates test inputs (for TDD/PBT) and validates code correctness.
    *   **Input (TDD):** Generator's code, specific test cases.
    *   **Input (PBT):** Generator's code, defined properties.
    *   **Output:** Test results, error reports, and critically, *failing inputs* (especially for PBT property violations).

#### PGS Iterative Loop Flowchart
```
+--+      +--+      +--+
| Generator Agent |-->| Tester Agent    |-->| Generator Agent |
| (Propose Code)  |      | (Validate Code  |      | (Refine Code)   |
|                 |      |  & Provide      |<--|                 |
|                 |      |  Feedback)      |-->|                 |
+--+      +--+      +--+
        ^                                                   |
        | Feedback loop for refinement                       |
        +-+
```

The feedback from the Tester Agent (especially minimal failing examples from PBT) enables the Generator Agent to quickly understand and fix semantic errors, driving the code towards a robust solution.

### Key Metrics for Comparison
To quantitatively assess PBT vs. TDD, we use metrics:

*   **Correctness Rate:** The percentage of problems for which a correct solution is eventually produced.
    $$ \text{Correctness Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Solutions}}{\text{Total Number of Problems}} $$
*   **Repair Success Rate:** How often the LLM successfully fixes issues identified.
    $$ \text{Repair Success Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Successful Repairs}}{\text{Number of Identified Issues}} $$
*   **Number of Iterations to Solution:** Average refinement steps.
*   **Test Coverage (PBT specific):** How thoroughly PBT explores the input space.
*   **Semantic Feedback Efficiency:** How well the feedback guides the LLM to semantically correct code.

These metrics, along with the interactive demonstration, will highlight the advantages of PBT.

## 5. Interactive Code Refinement: TDD vs. PBT in Action
Duration: 0:15:00

This is the core interactive section of QuLab, where you can directly observe the iterative refinement of LLM-generated code using either PBT or TDD.

Navigate to the **"5. Sectioned Implementation"** page in the sidebar.

### 5.1 Selecting a HumanEval Problem
First, ensure you've loaded the HumanEval dataset from the "3. Data/Inputs Overview" page.
You'll then be able to select a specific HumanEval problem by its `task_id` from a dropdown. You can also configure the maximum number of refinement iterations and a test timeout.

<aside class="positive">
The `Test Timeout` setting is crucial to prevent the application from hanging due to LLM-generated code entering infinite loops during test execution.
</aside>

### 5.2 Initial LLM-Generated Code (Mock)
Once a problem is selected, the application will display a mock initial code attempt from the Generator Agent. This code is a placeholder, designed to be plausible but often incorrect, simulating a first draft from an LLM.

```python
# application_pages/page5_implementation.py snippet
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import time
import sys
import io
import re

# Mock LLM and test execution functions (these would be actual LLM calls and test runners in a real app)

            return current_code.replace("return a / b", "return a / (b if b != 0 else 1)") # Simple fix example
        elif "negative result for positive inputs" in feedback["property_violation"]:
            return current_code.replace("return a - b", "return abs(a - b)") # Another simple fix
        else:
            return current_code + "\n    # Refined based on feedback: " + feedback["property_violation"] # Generic refinement
    elif current_code:
        return current_code + "\n    # Further refinement attempt"
    else:
        # Initial code generation
        # For demonstration, we'll return a simple incorrect function that matches the HumanEval structure
        return "def my_function(x, y):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is a placeholder function generated by LLM.\n    It simply returns the sum of x and y.\n    \"\"\"\n    return x + y" # A generic but perhaps incorrect initial LLM output

            if "return x + y" in code: # If the mock code is simple addition
                # Let's make it fail for a specific case for demonstration
                if (0 + 0) != 5: # This condition is always true, forcing a mock failure
                    success = False

After the loop, the "Refinement History" and "Final Refined Code" will be displayed, showing the progression and the ultimate attempt by the mock LLM. This interactive experience allows you to directly observe how feedback from PBT (often more detailed and actionable) can lead to different refinement paths compared to TDD.

## 6. Quantitative Comparison
Duration: 0:07:00

To move beyond qualitative observations, this section provides a quantitative comparison of PBT and TDD based on mock benchmark evaluations.

Navigate to the **"6. Quantitative Comparison"** page in the sidebar.

### 6.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The comparison is based on several key metrics:
*   **Correctness Rate:** $$ \text{Correctness Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Solutions}}{\text{Total Number of Problems}} $$
*   **Repair Success Rate:** $$ \text{Repair Success Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Successful Repairs}}{\text{Number of Identified Issues}} $$
*   **Iterations to Solution:** Average refinement steps.
*   **Test Coverage Score (PBT-specific):** How well PBT explores the input space.
*   **Semantic Feedback Efficiency:** Quality of feedback guiding the LLM.

### 6.2 Running the Mock Benchmark Evaluation

The `mock_run_benchmark_evaluation` function generates randomized, yet illustrative, performance data for both PBT and TDD. PBT results are generally simulated to be better across most metrics, reflecting its theoretical advantages.

### 6.3 Interpreting the Results
After the benchmark runs, three dataframes will be displayed:
*   **PBT Evaluation Results:** Detailed results for PBT.
*   **TDD Evaluation Results:** Detailed results for TDD.
*   **Combined Evaluation Results:** A consolidated view for direct comparison.

Examine the `correctness_rate`, `repair_success_rate`, and `iterations_to_solution` for both methods. You'll generally observe that PBT (in this simulated scenario) tends to achieve higher correctness and repair rates with fewer iterations, underscoring its efficiency.

## 7. Visualization of Results

To make the quantitative comparison more intuitive, this section provides interactive visualizations of the benchmark results using Plotly Express.

Navigate to the **"7. Visualization of Results"** page in the sidebar.

### 7.1 Illustrative Per-Iteration Trends
The application first displays line charts, conceptually showing how correctness and repair success rates might evolve over iterations. While the mock data in `page6_quantitative_comparison.py` doesn't strictly generate per-iteration *trend* data for the benchmark (it generates average iterations *to solution*), these plots serve as a visual aid to infer how each method *could* progress.

These line charts offer an abstract representation of how PBT might achieve a higher correctness rate more quickly (fewer iterations) than TDD.

### 7.2 Average Performance Comparison
Several bar charts are generated to compare the average performance of PBT and TDD across various KPIs.

These bar charts typically show PBT outperforming TDD in correctness rate, repair success rate, and often requiring fewer iterations. The "test_coverage_score" would also be higher for PBT, illustrating its broader input exploration.

### 7.3 Detailed Metric Comparison per Problem
A scatter plot allows you to select a specific metric and visualize how PBT and TDD performed on that metric for each individual problem ID in the benchmark.

This granular view can help identify if one method consistently performs better across a range of problems or if there are specific problem types where one excels.

## 8. Summary and Insights
Duration: 0:04:00

The final section synthesizes the key findings and insights derived from the interactive demonstrations and quantitative comparisons, reinforcing the value of Property-Based Testing for LLM-generated code.

Navigate to the **"8. Summary and Insights"** page in the sidebar.

### 8.1 Key Takeaways
The summary highlights several critical observations:

1.  **PBT's Strength in Edge Case Discovery:** PBT's ability to generate diverse, unexpected inputs makes it highly effective at uncovering subtle bugs and edge cases that traditional example-based tests miss. This leads to more robust code.
2.  **Faster Refinement with PBT-driven Feedback:** The specific, minimal failing examples provided by PBT (due to shrinking) offer richer and more actionable feedback to the Generator LLM. This semantic feedback accelerates the refinement process, often requiring fewer iterations to achieve a correct solution.
3.  **Improved Code Quality and Robustness:** PBT promotes code that adheres to fundamental truths, making it not just functionally correct for specific inputs but also semantically more reliable and resilient to a broader range of conditions.

### 8.2 Challenges and Considerations
While powerful, PBT also comes with its challenges:

*   **Property Definition:** Crafting effective and comprehensive properties for complex functions can be difficult, requiring a deep understanding of the problem domain.
*   **LLM Interpretation of Feedback:** The success of PBT also depends on the LLM's capability to accurately interpret property violation feedback and translate it into effective code changes.
*   **Performance Overhead:** The generative nature of PBT can sometimes lead to a higher computational cost compared to running a fixed, small set of unit tests, especially for complex properties or computationally intensive code.

### 8.3 Visualizing Overall Trends
The summary page also displays high-level bar charts showing the average correctness rate, iterations to solution, and test coverage for PBT vs. TDD, providing a quick visual recap of the main conclusions.

```python
# application_pages/page8_summary.py snippet

import plotly.express as px

def run_page():
    st.header("8. Summary and Insights")

    st.markdown("""
    This section summarizes the key findings and insights gained from comparing Property-Based Testing (PBT) and Traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) for refining LLM-generated code.

    ### Key Takeaways:

    1.  **PBT's Strength in Edge Case Discovery:** PBT consistently demonstrates a superior ability to uncover subtle bugs and edge cases that are often missed by fixed, example-based TDD tests. The generative nature of PBT's input exploration leads to more robust code.

    2.  **Faster Refinement with PBT-driven Feedback:** The rich, semantic feedback provided by PBT (i.e., minimal failing examples from shrinking) significantly accelerates the LLM's refinement process. This leads to fewer iterations required to achieve a correct and robust solution, as observed in the "Iterations to Solution" metric.

    3.  **Improved Code Quality and Robustness:** While TDD helps in achieving functional correctness for known examples, PBT pushes the LLM to generate code that adheres to fundamental properties, leading to code that is not just "correct" for specific inputs, but also semantically more robust and resilient to unexpected inputs.

    4.  **Challenges and Considerations:**
        *   **Property Definition:** Defining effective properties for complex functions can be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the problem domain. Poorly defined properties can lead to ineffective testing.
        *   **LLM Interpretation of Feedback:** The effectiveness of PBT also depends on the LLM's ability to interpret and act upon property violation feedback. Future LLMs will likely be even better at this.
        *   **Performance Overhead:** PBT can sometimes involve running a large number of generated tests, which might have a higher computational overhead compared to a small set of TDD unit tests, especially for very complex properties or slower code.
