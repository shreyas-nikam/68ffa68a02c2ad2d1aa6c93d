# Jupyter Notebook Specification: PBT vs TDD LLM Code Explorer

---

## 1. Notebook Overview

### Learning Goals
- Understand the fundamental differences between Property-Based Testing (PBT) and traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD).
- Demonstrate how PBT can more effectively detect semantic errors in code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) compared to TDD.
- Explore the HumanEval dataset to analyze LLM-generated functions with their canonical tests.
- Implement and visualize comparative testing results to showcase advantages of PBT in fault localization and code refinement.
- Illustrate iterative refinement cycles driven by PBT feedback leading to improved robustness in LLM-generated code.
- Learn key PBT concepts such as invariant properties and abstract validations applied to automated code testing.

## 2. Code Requirements

### Expected Libraries to Import (Python Ecosystem)
- `datasets` (from Hugging Face) – for loading the HumanEval dataset.
- `pytest` or `unittest` – for running traditional example-based test cases.
- `hypothesis` – for implementing Property-Based Testing constructs.
- `matplotlib` or `seaborn` – for generating visualizations comparing testing effectiveness.
- `pandas` – to organize and tabulate test results and metrics.
- `numpy` – for numerical operations and data handling.
- Optional: `IPython.display` – for enhanced visualization display or formatted outputs.

### Algorithms / Functions to Implement (no code, just definitions)
- **Load_HumanEval_Dataset:** Function to load and preprocess HumanEval dataset from Hugging Face `datasets` library.
- **Run_Traditional_TDD_Tests:** Runs canonical example-based tests (as provided in dataset) on functions and records pass/fail outcomes.
- **Define_PBT_Properties:** For each selected coding task, define property-checking functions that encapsulate key invariants or semantic constraints applicable to the problem.
- **Generate_PBT_Inputs:** Use property-based input strategies (via `hypothesis`) to generate diverse inputs covering typical, edge, and boundary cases.
- **Run_Property_Based_Tests:** Apply PBT checks to the LLM-generated functions with generated inputs and record pass/fail outcomes and property violations.
- **Visualize_Test_Comparison:** Generate comparative bar charts and confusion matrices to illustrate pass rates, fault localization ability, and discrepancy between TDD and PBT results.
- **Iterative_Refinement_Simulation:** (Optional) Demonstrate a hypothetical refinement loop where property violations guide successive function corrections improving the pass rate.
- **Summarize_Insights:** Aggregate and tabulate results emphasizing how PBT detects subtle semantic errors missed by example-driven TDD.

### Visualizations Required
- Bar chart comparing pass rates of TDD vs PBT across multiple functions.
- Tabular summary of individual test failures highlighting those detected only by PBT.
- Heatmap or confusion matrix indicating where TDD tests succeed but PBT properties fail (fault localization visualization).
- Line plot or iteration step chart showing improvement in function correctness over refinement cycles guided by PBT feedback.

## 3. Notebook Sections (Detailed)

### Section 1: Introduction and Background
- **Markdown cell:** Explain purpose of the notebook, introduce LLM code challenges, TDD limitations, and motivation for PBT.
- **Markdown cell:** Provide concise definition of TDD and PBT, highlighting the fundamental difference that TDD validates specific input-output pairs whereas PBT validates properties or invariants over all valid inputs.
- **Markdown cell:** Display a mathematical definition of property-based testing correctness using LaTeX:

  $$ \text{For all valid inputs } x \in D, \quad P(f(x)) = \text{True} $$

  where $P$ is a property that the output $f(x)$ must satisfy.

### Section 2: Dataset Loading and Exploration
- **Code cell:** Implement `Load_HumanEval_Dataset` that loads `openai_humaneval` test split via `datasets.load_dataset`.
- **Code cell:** Execute dataset loading and display a sample data instance:
  - Show problem prompt, canonical solution, and canonical test.
- **Markdown cell:** Explain dataset structure and relevance to code generation evaluation.

### Section 3: Traditional TDD Testing Setup
- **Markdown cell:** Introduce traditional testing by running canonical `check` functions on candidate solutions.
- **Code cell:** Implement `Run_Traditional_TDD_Tests` function that executes the provided canonical tests (assertions) for selected tasks.
- **Code cell:** Run TDD tests on example functions and show test outcomes (pass/fail).
- **Markdown cell:** Explain the limitations of example-based tests, especially how they can miss semantic errors due to limited input coverage.

### Section 4: Property-Based Testing Setup
- **Markdown cell:** Introduce PBT principles: validating semantic properties or invariants rather than specific outputs.
- **Markdown cell:** For HumanEval tasks, explain deriving high-level properties, e.g., for a sorting function:

  $$ \forall x \in \text{List}, \quad \text{sorted}(f(x)) \land \text{is\_permutation}(f(x), x) $$

- **Code cell:** Implement `Define_PBT_Properties` for a selected set of HumanEval tasks—define Python functions that check invariants. These property functions take candidate input and output and return `True/False`.
- **Code cell:** Implement `Generate_PBT_Inputs` using `hypothesis` strategies based on problem types (e.g., lists of integers, positive integers).
- **Markdown cell:** Explain how PBT input generators cover broader input space including edge cases.

### Section 5: Running PBT Tests and Recording Results
- **Code cell:** Implement `Run_Property_Based_Tests` that runs property checks on LLM-generated functions over generated inputs, catching and recording property violations.
- **Code cell:** Execute PBT tests on example functions and summarize results (e.g., number of failing inputs found).
- **Markdown cell:** Explain how PBT identifies semantic errors by invariant violations beyond pass/fail on canonical tests.

### Section 6: Comparative Visualization of TDD vs PBT Outcomes
- **Code cell:** Implement `Visualize_Test_Comparison` which plots bar charts of pass rates for TDD and PBT.
- **Code cell:** Generate tables that list specific test cases or inputs where TDD passes but PBT fails, illustrating improved fault localization.
- **Markdown cell:** Interpret the visualization, explaining how and why PBT provides richer feedback to detect semantic bugs.

### Section 7: Iterative Refinement Cycle of PBT (Conceptual Demonstration)
- **Markdown cell:** Explain the iterative refinement framework: the code is refined based on PBT feedback until properties are satisfied.
- **Code cell:** Simulate or pseudocode an iterative loop where failing property inputs guide code fixes.
- **Code cell:** Show hypothetical improvement in pass rate over iterations.
- **Markdown cell:** Discuss insights on robustness gain using PBT-guided refinement.

### Section 8: Summary and Conclusions
- **Markdown cell:** Summarize key takeaways about PBT’s superiority for testing LLM-generated code.
- **Markdown cell:** Outline practical implications for software developers and researchers.
- **Markdown cell:** Suggest further reading and advanced topics.
